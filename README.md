# Discovery

_Discovery is a platform where youth of age 3 and up can learn about the world._

## User Experience

At the core, we have 6 main areas:

- Stories
- The World Around Us
- The Human Body
- Language
- Interesting Facts

For each of these, the specific areas and the outcomes, with difficulty arrangements can be seen at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZbCabpoOqrIBU0L5Dvit12S0021x0Dnq2vzYHs1rlOM/edit?usp=sharing

For each of these areas as well, we want to make the experience as encapsulated and consistent as possible. The simple steps of learning will be:

1. Homepage has all 6 areas
2. Select a main area from the 6
3. Land on homepage for main area
4. Immediately be proposed with:
   - Horizontal lists of thumbnails that open as larger videos on click, if no nested sub areas exist
   - Conditional display from bar of choices if nested sub areas exist, and then each display contains the above
